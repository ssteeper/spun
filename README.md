# Spun, Not Drawn

## Thesis

A spider web is not a shape. It is the fossil of a behaviour. Each record in a specimen preserves one step of a spider's thread-laying itinerary; later phases will build and render the nine Australian spiders and their webs.

## The `.silk` format

Version 1 is little-endian. A 32-byte header (`<4sHHHHIIHHHBBB3x`) holds magic `SILK`, version `1`, header/record/bead sizes `32/20/8`, segment and bead counts (u32), canvas width and height (u16), coordinate scale `4` (u16), width scale `32` (u8), zero flags (u8), builder count `1–3` (u8), and three zero reserved bytes. The first record starts at byte 32; beads directly follow the records. Files must end immediately after the beads.

Each 20-byte record (`<4HI8B`) stores x0, y0, x1, y1 in canvas pixels ×4 (u16); its removal index (u32, or `0xFFFFFFFF` if permanent); and eight bytes in this order: kind, width (pixels ×32), red, green, blue, LOD, flags, alpha. Flag bits 0, 1 and 2 mean sticky, environment and invisible; bits 4–5 select the builder. Records are emitted in construction order and never changed by replay.

Each 8-byte bead (`<IHBB`) stores its host record index (u32), fraction along that host ×65535 (u16), radius in pixels ×16 (u8), and flags (u8). Bead flag bits 0, 1 and 2 mean satellite, glue and lure. In-memory NumPy structured dtypes use these exact layouts, so serialization writes header + records.tobytes() + beads.tobytes() without per-record repacking. Coordinates, widths and bead sizes use nearest-even rounding at the stated scales.

## Decisions

- The checkout directory itself is the project root; the Python package is its direct child `spun/`.
- Header version, sizes, scales, reserved bytes and file length are checked when decoding. The validator maps malformed files to Rule 1 and reports Rules 1–9 by number. Rule 10's byte-identical consecutive-build check belongs with the build tool.
- Validator metadata holds specimen kind, one hub/frame polygon and radial endpoints per orb builder, open-sector angular intervals, the golden flag, 512 timeline cursors, stage boundaries, per-builder spinneret rest positions, and catalogue/index/default asset byte totals. Geometry and rest positions are checked against decoded, quantized records rather than trusting claims of validity in metadata.
- Geometric limits use inclusive CV bounds; a capture junction is assigned to a declared spoke only within half a native pixel of that spoke to accommodate quarter-pixel quantization. Budget KB/MB are interpreted as KiB/MiB.
